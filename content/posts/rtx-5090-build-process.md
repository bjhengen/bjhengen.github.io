ðŸš€ **The Build Day Has Arrived!** After months of anticipation and planning, the RTX 5090 finally launched and it was time to bring my AI/ML powerhouse to life.

This is more than just a computer build - it's the foundation for exploring the cutting edge of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Every component was carefully selected to maximize performance for training neural networks, running inference, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with consumer AI hardware.

ðŸ“¸ **Complete Visual Documentation** - Follow along with 25 high-resolution photos and exclusive first-boot video footage as I transform a pile of premium components into a purpose-built AI training beast.

### RTX 5090 First Boot Test

Before committing to the final case assembly, I wanted to test the RTX 5090 to ensure it was working properly. Here's the moment of truth - the first time powering up the card:

</video>
*RTX 5090 first boot test - verifying the card works before final assembly*

This was a crucial step in the build process. Testing the GPU outside the case allowed me to verify functionality and ensure all power connections were solid before doing the final assembly and cable management.

## Step 8: Final Assembly & Completion (~1.5 hours)

## Build Summary

The entire build took approximately 6 hours from start to finish, with the bulk of the time spent on:
- Careful component installation to avoid any damage
- Meticulous cable management for optimal airflow
- Multiple test boots to ensure stability
- Fine-tuning component placement

## Key Learnings

- **Cable management is crucial** - Took extra time but resulted in much better airflow
- **Test early and often** - Multiple test boots caught potential issues early
- **RTX 5090 installation** - Required careful handling due to size and weight
- **Power delivery** - Ensuring adequate power connectors for the high-end GPU

## Next Steps

With the hardware build complete, the next phase involves:
- OS installation and driver setup
- AI/ML framework installation (CUDA, PyTorch, etc.)
- Performance benchmarking
- First training runs

Stay tuned for the software setup and initial performance results!
