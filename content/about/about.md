## The Mission

This blog documents my hands-on exploration of **Specialized Language Models (SLMs)**—the hypothesis that smaller, domain-focused AI models can outperform general-purpose giants on specific tasks.

Since September 2025, I've been building, fine-tuning, and testing this thesis with real applications:

| Project | What I Learned |
|---------|---------------|
| **ChefBot** | A cooking AI that coordinates multi-dish meal prep—specialists excel at domain knowledge |
| **Executive Assistant** | An AI trained on 5+ years of my management notes—data quality trumps model size |
| **3-LLM Toggle** | Balancing cloud, local, and GPU inference—flexibility beats optimization |
| **Multi-Model Collaboration** | Two AIs pair programming—specialists need generalists, and vice versa |

Every experiment runs on my RTX 5090 workstation, with findings documented here for others walking a similar path.

## About Me

I'm **Brian Hengen**, Vice President at **Oracle**, where I lead technical sales engineering teams focused on AI and database technologies.

By day, I help enterprises adopt AI-powered data solutions. By night (and early mornings), I build things—fine-tuning models, writing code, and testing ideas that might not work.

**What drives me:**
- The belief that AI should be practical, not theoretical
- A conviction that smaller, specialized models have an outsized role to play
- The joy of building something that actually runs

**Background:**
- 20+ years in technology leadership
- Self-taught programmer since age 7
- Former Oracle DBA who learned by being thrown into the deep end
- No college degree—just relentless curiosity
