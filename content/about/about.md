## About This Blog

This blog documents my journey building and running a **personal AI workstation** from the ground up.  

The focus is on **Specialized Language Models (SLMs)** — training, fine-tuning, and experimenting with how domain-specific AI can solve real-world problems.  

Along the way, I'll share:
- Daily build updates (with photos),
- Lessons learned on hardware, software, and workflows,
- Reflections on how AI can be applied in business and everyday productivity.

If you're curious about what it takes to get hands-on with cutting-edge AI — from raw components to working models — you're in the right place.

## About Me

Hi, I'm Brian — a technology executive, DBA, and developer who is passionate about AI, data, and innovation.  

By day, I lead technical sales engineering teams. By night (and often early mornings), I tinker with code, experiment with new ideas, and explore how **Specialized Language Models (SLMs)** and AI can be applied to real-world challenges.  

This blog is my personal project to document the journey of building a high-performance AI workstation and using it as a testbed for fine-tuning and experimenting with SLMs. My aim is to share insights that are practical, approachable, and hopefully useful to others walking a similar path.
